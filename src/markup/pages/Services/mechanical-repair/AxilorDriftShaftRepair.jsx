					  As we all know the axle/driveshaft is one of the important mechanical components of the car. The drive shaft usually converts the power generated by the engine into usable force (torque) which is essential for the wheels to spin and the car to work.
                      </p>
                      <p className="mb-15">
					  When the driveshaft in the car is not maintained properly, it may result in reduced performance and poor fuel efficiency.
                      </p>
					  <p className="mb-15">
					  So it becomes essential for every car owner to diagnose and fix the drive shaft problems earlier when they occur to avoid expensive repair bills and ensure smooth performance on the roads.
